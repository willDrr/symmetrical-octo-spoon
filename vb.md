Here's an example of how you can create a macro in Excel to fetch the commission amount from the SharePoint file:

1. Open the Excel file stored locally.
2. Press `Alt + F11` to open the Visual Basic Editor.
3. In the Visual Basic Editor, insert a new module by clicking on "Insert" and then selecting "Module."
4. In the module, write the following VBA code:

```vba
Sub FetchCommissionAmountFromSharePoint()
    Dim SharePointFilePath As String
    Dim SharePointWorkbook As Workbook
    Dim CommissionSheet As Worksheet
    Dim CommissionCell As Range
    Dim CommissionAmount As Double
    
    ' Set the SharePoint file path
    SharePointFilePath = "https://sharepoint.com/examplefile.xlsx" ' Replace with the actual SharePoint file URL
    
    ' Open the SharePoint workbook
    Set SharePointWorkbook = Workbooks.Open(SharePointFilePath)
    
    ' Set the Commission sheet and cell
    Set CommissionSheet = SharePointWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1") ' Replace "Sheet1" with the actual sheet name
    Set CommissionCell = CommissionSheet.Range("B2") ' Replace "B2" with the actual cell reference
    
    ' Get the Commission amount from the cell
    CommissionAmount = CommissionCell.Value
    
    ' Update the Commission amount in the local Excel file
    ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("C2").Value = CommissionAmount ' Replace "Sheet1" and "C2" with the actual sheet name and cell reference in the local file
    
    ' Close the SharePoint workbook
    SharePointWorkbook.Close SaveChanges:=False
End Sub
```

5. Modify the `SharePointFilePath`, `CommissionSheet`, `CommissionCell`, and the destination cell in the local Excel file (`ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("C2")`) to match your actual file and cell references.
6. Save the changes and close the Visual Basic Editor.
7. Back in the Excel file, you can assign the macro to a button by going to the "Developer" tab (if not visible, enable it in Excel settings) and selecting "Insert" in the Controls group. Choose a button and draw it on your worksheet. In the "Assign Macro" dialog box, select the `FetchCommissionAmountFromSharePoint` macro you just created.
8. Now, whenever you click the button, the macro will fetch the commission amount from the SharePoint file and update the corresponding cell in the local Excel file.

Remember to replace the SharePoint file URL, sheet names, and cell references in the code with your actual values. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the SharePoint file from your local Excel file.

This solution allows you to automate the process of fetching the commission amount, reducing the risk of errors or omissions when updating the data manually.
